# Best Practices for Security and Efficiency

This document outlines best practices implemented in the ClassLink Integration Demonstrator to ensure security, performance, and maintainability. These principles support the application’s architecture and operation in a production-ready environment.

## I. Security Best Practices

### 1. Secrets Management via AWS Secrets Manager

**Practice:** All sensitive credentials (e.g., API tokens, OIDC client secrets) are retrieved at runtime from **AWS Secrets Manager**. Secrets are never hardcoded or committed to version control.

**Benefit:** Prevents accidental exposure of sensitive credentials and allows secure rotation of secrets without modifying application code.

---

### 2. Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP)

**Practice:** Each AWS Lambda function is assigned an IAM execution role with only the permissions required to perform its intended function.

Examples:
- The `classlink-data-ingestion` function has write access to DynamoDB and read access to Secrets Manager.
- The `get-user-data` function has read-only access to DynamoDB.

**Benefit:** Minimizes the blast radius of a potential compromise by limiting access to only what is explicitly required.

### 3. Secured OAuth2 Authorization Flow

**Practice:** ClassLink's OAuth2 and OIDC login flow is used for user authentication. After login, a one-time authorization code is exchanged securely for an access token using backend logic.

**Benefit:** Authentication occurs through ClassLink's secure LaunchPad system. No sensitive tokens are exposed on the client side, and the server verifies access through a backend-only token exchange.

---

### 4. Backend-Only Data Access

**Practice:** The frontend does not connect directly to DynamoDB or any data source. All data is accessed via a secure AWS Lambda endpoint behind API Gateway.

**Benefit:** Eliminates the risk of direct database exposure. Ensures all data requests are controlled, validated, and logged.

---

### 5. Environment-Specific Frontend Configuration

**Practice:** The frontend uses Vite `.env` files (e.g., `.env.local`) to store API URLs and other configuration variables. These files are excluded from source control via `.gitignore`.

**Benefit:** Allows secure and flexible environment configuration across development, staging, and production environments without code changes.

---

## II. Efficiency and Maintainability Best Practices

### 1. Serverless Architecture

**Practice:** Backend functions are implemented using **AWS Lambda** and invoked via **API Gateway**.

**Benefit:**
- **Cost-efficient:** Compute is charged only during function execution.
- **Scalable:** Functions scale automatically with traffic volume.
- **Low maintenance:** No server provisioning or patching required.

---

### 2. Efficient Batch Writes to DynamoDB

**Practice:** The ingestion pipeline uses DynamoDB’s `batch_writer()` to perform high-volume inserts during data sync from ClassLink.

**Benefit:** Reduces latency and handles retry logic automatically for failed write operations, improving throughput and resilience.

---

### 3. Pagination for Scalable API Requests

**Practice:** ClassLink API endpoints that return large datasets (e.g., `/v2/users`) are accessed using offset-based pagination (e.g., `?limit=1000&offset=2000`).

**Benefit:** Supports controlled, chunked data ingestion and prevents timeouts or memory overflow during synchronization.

---

### 4. Component-Based Frontend UI

**Practice:** The React application is composed of modular components (`TeacherDashboard`, `StudentDashboard`, `Modal`, etc.).

**Benefit:** Promotes code reuse, testability, and maintainability. Each component has a single responsibility and can be updated independently.

---

### 5. Role-Based Rendering and Data Fetching

**Practice:** The backend returns only the data relevant to the authenticated user’s role (student or teacher). For teachers, class rosters are included.

**Benefit:** Improves efficiency and privacy. Reduces the volume of frontend-rendered data while tailoring the UI experience per user type.
