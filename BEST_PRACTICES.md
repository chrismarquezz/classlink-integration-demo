# Best Practices for Security and Efficiency

This document outlines best practices implemented in the ClassLink Integration Demo to ensure security, performance, and maintainability. These principles support the applicationâ€™s architecture and operation in a production-ready environment.

## I. Security Best Practices

### 1. Secrets Management via AWS Secrets Manager

**Practice:** All sensitive credentials (e.g., API tokens, OIDC client secrets) are retrieved at runtime from **AWS Secrets Manager**. Secrets are never hardcoded or committed to version control.

**Benefit:** Prevents accidental exposure of sensitive credentials and allows secure rotation of secrets without modifying application code.

### 2. Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP)

**Practice:** Each AWS Lambda function is assigned an IAM execution role with only the permissions required to perform its intended function.

**Examples:**
- The `classlink-data-ingestion` function has write access to DynamoDB and read access to Secrets Manager.
- The `get-user-data` function has read-only access to DynamoDB.

**Benefit:** Minimizes the blast radius of a potential compromise by limiting access to only what is explicitly required.

### 3. Secured OAuth2 Authorization Flow

**Practice:** ClassLink's OAuth2 and OIDC login flow is used for user authentication. After login, a one-time authorization code is exchanged securely for an access token using backend logic.

**Benefit:** Authentication occurs through ClassLink's secure LaunchPad system. No sensitive tokens are exposed on the client side, and the server verifies access through a backend-only token exchange.

## II. Data Architecture Best Practices

### 1. Composite Keys for Multi-Tenancy

**Practice:** A composite key, formed by concatenating the `tenantId` and `sourcedId` (`tenantId_sourcedId`), is used as the primary `userId` in the DynamoDB tables.

**Benefit:** The `sourcedId` from the Roster Server API is only unique *within* a specific tenant (e.g., a school district). This composite key strategy creates a globally unique identifier for every user across all possible tenants, preventing data collisions and ensuring data integrity.

---

### 2. Data Isolation for Multiple Tenants

**Practice:** For applications designed to handle data from multiple tenants simultaneously, the recommended best practice is to segregate data into separate DynamoDB tables for each tenant.

**Benefit:** This ensures strict data isolation and security, preventing any possibility of one tenant's data being accidentally exposed to another.

## III. Efficiency and Maintainability Best Practices

### 1. Serverless Architecture

**Practice:** Backend functions are implemented using **AWS Lambda** and invoked via **API Gateway**.

**Benefit:**
- **Cost-efficient:** Compute is charged only during function execution.
- **Scalable:** Functions scale automatically with traffic volume.
- **Low maintenance:** No server provisioning or patching required.
